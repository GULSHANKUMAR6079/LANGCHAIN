A very good evening to you ladies and
0:05
gentlemen. We can do better. A very good
0:07
evening to you ladies and
0:10
gentlemen. Oh wow. It's an absolute joy,
0:14
honor and pleasure to be here this
0:17
evening. Let me kick this evening off
0:19
with a favorite story of mine.
0:23
There was a little boy about 6 years old
0:26
who came to a balloon seller who was
0:29
selling balloons on the
0:31
street and he asked the balloon seller,
0:35
"Uncle, will this red balloon go up in
0:37
the
0:38
air?" The balloon seller said, "Of
0:40
course it will." Said, "And the blue
0:43
one?" 100% it will. The pink one, most
0:49
certainly it will. And you know how kids
0:51
can be. They can ask funny questions and
0:54
I give funny answers as well. A
0:57
4-year-old once came to a shopkeeper and
0:59
said to the shopkeeper girl, he said,
1:04
"Uncle, fouryear-old girl." The
1:06
shopkeeper
1:08
said, he said
1:15
uncle. The shopkeeper
1:18
said, he said
1:25
uncle
1:27
children very innocent, charming,
1:32
clever, smart. They can ask funny
1:35
questions and they can give funny
1:36
answers too. A teacher in class asked a
1:40
six-year-old which state of India are
1:42
you from? He said I'm from Arunachal
1:45
Pradesh madam. She said can you spell it
1:47
for me? He said I'm from Goa
1:50
actually. Who spells Arunachal
1:53
Pradesh? Kids are kid are kids aren't
1:56
they? This little boy asked will the
1:58
pink balloon go up? Will the red balloon
2:00
go up? Will the black balloon go up?
2:02
Will the blue balloon go up? The
2:05
exasperated balloon seller said, "Look,
2:08
darling." The balloons don't go up in
2:11
the air based on their
2:13
colors. The balloons go up in the air
2:16
based on what's filled inside of them,
2:19
the gas, the air. That's what takes the
2:22
balloons to the heights of success.
2:27
Boys and
2:28
girls, the class of
2:31
2023, we are all different colored
2:34
balloons with different abilities,
2:36
different skill sets, different
2:39
backgrounds, different
2:41
upbringings, different family cultures,
2:44
different traditions, different
2:46
opportunities, different resources,
2:49
different
2:50
challenges. We all have a very different
2:53
outside.
2:55
But guess what? Everybody who has
2:58
reached the heights of success and has
3:01
made a mark in the world hasn't ever
3:05
done it based on the color of the
3:06
balloon. Hasn't ever done it based on
3:09
resources. Hasn't ever done it based on
3:11
opportunities. Hasn't ever done it based
3:13
on skills. Hasn't ever done it based on
3:16
what they've just learned in school,
3:18
college, and universities.
3:20
These are all the colors of the balloons
3:22
and extremely
3:24
important. Everybody who's left a mark
3:28
in the world and has made the world a
3:30
better place are the ones who had the
3:34
right kind of gas filled inside their
3:36
balloons. As we sort our outside, it is
3:41
very very crucial and important to fix
3:44
our inside because only those who have
3:47
their inside sorted and inside
3:50
fixed have reached
3:53
high in high up in the sky. Which is why
3:57
don't they say it's not our
4:01
aptitude but our attitude that decides
4:05
our altitude in our life? Yes. Yes. We
4:11
definitely we definitely need aptitude.
4:15
Our schools, our universities, our
4:17
teachers have given us the aptitude. But
4:20
along with that they've also given us
4:22
the right attitude by their own example.
4:25
Our families have given us the right
4:27
attitude by their own
4:30
example. When you see an
4:32
iceberg, you see only the tip of the
4:35
iceberg on the surface of the water.
4:37
Don't we? The achievements of others,
4:41
their success, their popularity, their
4:44
achievements, their accolades, their
4:46
wealth, their money, their fancy cars,
4:49
their homes, their fancy vacations and
4:52
holidays is all the tip of the iceberg.
4:55
What we
4:57
see. But right underneath that surface
5:00
is a huge humongous iceberg which is
5:05
unseen to the eyes of the world. The
5:07
world sees the tip of the iceberg. The
5:09
money, the popularity, the success, the
5:12
achievements. What we do fail to see is
5:15
the huge
5:16
iceberg underneath the surface of the
5:19
water. The failures, the patience, the
5:23
determination, the grit, the courage,
5:27
the troubles, the struggles, the
5:30
resilience, the tenacity.
5:33
All of these is what makes that little
5:37
tip sustainable and seen to the world.
5:40
As you are now going to embark on your
5:42
new journey and as you work on achieving
5:45
that tip of the iceberg, my prayer today
5:48
is that may you never forget the unseen.
5:51
Take inspiration from your heroes, from
5:54
your role models, from your families,
5:56
from your
5:57
teachers and learn. There's a humongous
6:01
iceberg underneath that surface of the
6:04
water that's responsible for the tip of
6:06
the iceberg to remain there. Remember
6:09
always, it takes a lot of sleepless
6:12
nights to become an overnight success.
6:17
And therefore, and therefore, here's the
6:20
first principle that I want to share
6:22
with all of you today. If you want to
6:24
get the
6:25
scene, focus and work on the unseen. If
6:29
you want the tip to be up there, focus
6:31
on the huge iceberg underneath the
6:33
surface. If you want your balloon, the
6:35
beautiful colored balloon to soar high
6:37
up, focus on what's filled inside as
6:41
well. How many of you love going on a
6:44
holiday? All of us. How many of you love
6:48
traveling? Oh, okay. I must put my hand
6:52
down. I hate
6:54
traveling because in a year sometimes I
6:57
end up taking over 300 to 325
7:01
flights. That's insanity when it comes
7:05
to traveling. And you can have all kinds
7:08
of experiences when you travel. Like I
7:10
was flying once and the stew artist
7:11
comes up to me. I'm not going to mention
7:12
the airline. Mr. comes up to me and
7:15
says, "Well, come on board, sir. We
7:16
guarantee
7:19
takeoff." I said, "Landing,
7:22
madam." She said, "You're a monk, isn't
7:25
it? It's important to
7:27
pray." Oh,
7:29
takeoffs and
7:31
landings. The three biggest fears people
7:34
had back in the day were number one, the
7:36
fear of public speaking. Anybody
7:38
here? Okay. Number two was the fear of
7:42
death. Anybody here? Okay. Number three
7:45
was the fear of flying on an airplane. I
7:48
guess that's why they call an airport a
7:51
terminal.
7:53
Possibly.
7:56
Possibly. Oh, and those three fears have
7:59
now been replaced with three biggest
8:01
fears today. Number one, battery of the
8:04
smartphone
8:06
dying. Number two, poor Wi-Fi signal.
8:10
And number three, that we learn your
8:12
phone, which says still buffering when
8:14
you're watching a Netflix
8:17
show. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
8:19
girls, in my experience of travel, I
8:22
hate
8:23
travel because it's just so much of it.
8:27
But how long can you keep saying, "I
8:29
hate it. I hate it. I hate it." I don't
8:32
know when do we stop the selfdefeating
8:34
talk. I hate this subject. I hate
8:37
leaving home. I hate going here. I hate
8:39
doing this. I hate I hate I hate I hate
8:42
the selfdefeating talk stops us from
8:47
reaching where we want to reach in our
8:50
lives. Uh I I have traveled to the
8:54
United States. I said I I said right I'm
8:57
like do insane stuff. I am an insane
8:59
guy. I I remember going to the US once,
9:04
flying to New York City and then going
9:06
to Orlando for a talk.
9:09
I was in the US for 16
9:11
hours. I flew for 22 hours to be in the
9:16
US for 16 hours and got back to Mumbai
9:20
for another function. And in 6 days
9:22
after that, I flew back to New York City
9:26
17 1/2 hours to be there for 48 hours
9:31
and come back again for a function in
9:33
Mumbai. 3 days after that I flew back
9:37
again to
9:39
Chicago to be there for 36
9:43
hours to come back to Mumbai and at the
9:47
immigration there was an afroamerican
9:49
gentleman sitting there he said why
9:51
don't you just stay young man you're
9:53
just zipping in and out all the time and
9:57
guess what I
9:58
learned when you're traveling so much 17
10:02
and 1/2 hours of
10:03
flight Mumbai to New
10:07
York. We are all looking forward to
10:09
reach the destination when the flight
10:12
lands. But in looking forward to the
10:15
destination, very often, ladies and
10:18
gentlemen, boys and girls, you forget to
10:20
enjoy the journey. What a sheer waste of
10:25
17 and a half hours. If I say I hate
10:28
flying, I don't hate this. I hate being
10:31
on the flight. I hate this food on the
10:33
flight. I hate being on the seat. I hate
10:37
I hate I hate and I only be happy when I
10:41
land and I'm in New York City. I have
10:43
wasted 17 and a half hours of my
10:46
precious time. I have wasted my
10:50
journey. What I want to share with all
10:52
of you is we move from one point to
10:55
another point. Go from one destination
10:58
to another. You came here in the
10:59
kindergarten. You moved to grade
11:02
one. Destination point A to B. In
11:06
between the journey was 365 days. And
11:09
you've been moving from one destination
11:11
to another. Today at the school is your
11:14
final
11:16
destination. You move out now looking
11:18
forward to your next destination at
11:21
Colombia, at NYC, at Yale, at Stanford,
11:26
at
11:27
Oxford. And what I do want to share with
11:29
all of you is destinations are
11:32
important but do not forget to enjoy the
11:35
journey because the journey to the
11:38
destination is very long and I've seen a
11:42
lot of times that we become destination
11:45
addicts and forget to enjoy. How many of
11:48
you had a great time at
11:51
DIS? How many of you had a great time
11:54
with your
11:55
friends? How many of you enjoyed the
11:59
journey? Okay. Wow. I looks like I need
12:03
to take my clothes off and come back
12:06
madam to
12:08
Edis to experience this beautiful
12:11
journey. I was sharing with her an
12:13
interesting story. This is a class in
12:16
London 7year-olds and a teacher asked
12:19
all the kids what do you want to be when
12:21
you grow
12:22
up? Some of them said doctors, some of
12:24
them said lawyers. Some of them said
12:26
actors, some of them said
12:29
solicitors. One boy was quiet. The
12:33
teacher turned to the boy and said,
12:34
"Does it take that long to answer that
12:38
question?" Very thoughtfully, the boy
12:40
said, "When I grow up, madam, I want to
12:43
be
12:45
happy." The teacher said,
12:48
"Boy, looks like you haven't got the
12:50
question right."
12:53
The seven-year-old said,
12:56
"Ma'am, looks like you haven't got life
13:01
right." Because if you would have gotten
13:03
life right, you would know that
13:05
everything that we do is wanting to be
13:07
happy. And this answer was given by the
13:09
legendary John Lennon of the Beatles
13:12
crew. Right? It was John Lennon who said
13:14
this, "You didn't get life right. And
13:17
therefore as you move from one
13:19
destination to another do not forget to
13:23
enjoy the journey and be happy. How many
13:27
of you failed in any exam ever in your
13:30
life? Okay. Some courageous souls
13:33
raising their
13:35
hands. A boy was once walking with his
13:38
dad collegegoing boy and his friend
13:41
messaged him said our Costco college
13:44
results are going to be out very soon.
13:46
The boy messaged back saying, "I'm
13:48
walking with
13:49
dad." If he picks the phone up and he
13:53
sees I failed in a subject, I'll be
13:55
taken for a task. So, let's communicate
13:57
in code language. If I fail in one
14:00
subject, say good morning to you. I'll
14:03
understand. If you if I fail in two, say
14:05
good morning to you and dad. I'll
14:07
understand. A couple of minutes back, he
14:09
got a message saying good morning to
14:11
you, dad, family, and friends.
14:18
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
14:20
girls, we all have had our own failures.
14:24
We all have had our own
14:26
disappointments. And as you embark on
14:28
this new journey, you'll have
14:30
yours. Life is what it is. With all our
14:33
dreams, with all our aspirations, with
14:35
all our ambitions, life does what it
14:38
does to us. And when failures do come,
14:41
disappointments do come, we need
14:43
something very incredible. I remember
14:47
when I was graduating and I was
14:48
finishing my diploma in
14:50
engineering, I stood second in the state
14:53
of
14:54
Maharashtra and I missed my first
14:57
rank by four
14:59
marks. I was very very
15:03
disappointed. I came back home bit with
15:06
tears in my eyes and it is at that time
15:10
I remember my father coming in patting
15:13
on my back and said look dear son people
15:16
will forget the grades and people will
15:18
forget the marks at the end of it all
15:22
what matters is to keep that
15:25
spark
15:27
alive we need somebody to help us keep
15:31
that spark alive borrow a glass of
15:34
water.
15:36
Thank you so much.
15:39
You know
15:40
something? All of us in us have the
15:46
spark. All of us. That spark to do
15:50
something, that spark to make a
15:52
difference, that spark to succeed, that
15:56
spark to soar
15:57
high. And this is what life does to us.
16:02
dunks
16:03
us in a glass of
16:06
water. This is what life did to me when
16:09
I wanted
16:10
to stand
16:12
first. I was disappointed. I lost my
16:15
first rank in the state of Maharashtra
16:18
for four
16:19
marks. And what life does to us kills
16:22
that spark
16:26
within. This is what life does.
16:30
extinguishes the
16:32
spark. Sometimes we feel I just can't
16:35
keep going. I can't do it. I can't I
16:37
feel
16:38
helpless. It's at those
16:41
times that we need
16:44
somebody to trigger that
16:47
spark back within us.
16:56
If you don't have this
16:59
somebody, we'll be lost. For me, it was
17:02
my
17:03
dad. And I hate saying it. I disagreed
17:07
with him. I didn't speak to him for two
17:10
full
17:11
years. He had to fall on my feet and
17:14
say, "Sorry, son." For whatever I did, I
17:17
didn't say you're sorry. My father left
17:20
in the year 2009. And every single year
17:22
I felt I'll go and
17:24
say, "Sorry,
17:27
Dad. I shouldn't have put you through
17:31
this." He was the one who stood by me to
17:35
light me up. And I in my young Zeal and
17:39
in my young enthusiasm to achieve and be
17:42
who I
17:43
was was very rude.
17:46
very rude to the same
17:51
people who light us
17:53
up. The graduating class of
17:57
2023, when life takes the spark off, you
18:02
will need
18:03
someone. Is it your mom, your dad, your
18:05
teachers, your mentors, your guides,
18:08
your friends? Find somebody who will
18:11
light you up. That is the third thing I
18:13
would like to share with you this
18:14
evening. And here's
18:16
the last little
18:19
thing, the
18:22
light. Since I fly so much, if the store
18:27
doesn't come up for that day, I'd
18:29
probably end up making the announcements
18:31
myself. If there be a lack of oxygen
18:34
supply in the
18:35
caveman, oxygen masks will deploy from
18:38
the panel above your head.
18:40
Pull the mask sharply to activate the
18:43
flow of oxygen. Secure the mask on your
18:48
face and nose and breathe normally. Make
18:52
sure your mask is in place before you
18:56
help children, infants or others. It is
19:01
very important to put our mask in place
19:04
before we can put the mask on somebody
19:07
else. Mark Twain said something very
19:10
interesting. He said there are two most
19:11
important days in life. One is the day
19:14
when we were born and second is the day
19:17
we find out why we were born in this
19:21
world. You were all born to make a
19:24
difference. You were all born to be
19:27
change makers. You were all born to be a
19:31
catalyst of change in the sometimes dark
19:36
world that we live in. But do remember
19:39
if you don't have your mask on, you
19:41
wouldn't be able to put the mask on
19:43
anybody else's face at all. And which is
19:46
why as you achieve, as you grow, as you
19:49
make your balloon soar high in the sky,
19:52
as you make sure that the tip of your
19:53
iceberg is up
19:55
there, do not forget to care for
19:59
yourself. You deserve more than what
20:02
you're giving yourself. more respect,
20:05
more love, more time, more kindness,
20:08
more compassion. And when you receive
20:10
all of that, you will definitely be in a
20:13
position to share it with others. So,
20:16
graduating class of 2023, number one,
20:20
work on the unseen so that the scene can
20:23
soar high up. Graduating class of
20:27
2023. Lesson number two, do not forget
20:31
to be happy during the journey because
20:33
the journey can be a long one until we
20:35
reach our destination. Lesson number
20:38
three, always have somebody when you
20:41
lose it to bring that spark back again
20:45
in you. And my last parting thing, make
20:49
sure your oxygen mask is in place
20:52
because you have a bright future to make
20:54
a difference in this world by being
20:57
impactful.
